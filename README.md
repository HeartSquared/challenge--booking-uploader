# Challenge - Booking Uploader

Seer Medical coding challenge https://github.com/seermedical/challenge-booking-uploader

## Run the app

- To install dependencies: `yarn install`
- To run ExpressJS server: `yarn run server`
- To run ReactJS app: `yarn start`

## Notes

- I do not normally use inline styles, but when I tried to set up [@vanilla-extract/css](https://vanilla-extract.style/) on the base using [craco](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/craco), there was a problem compiling.
  - WIP on branch `refactor/use-vanilla-extract-css`
